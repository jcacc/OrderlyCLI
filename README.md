# Code_KY_SD2_Final
Order management system for multiple fulfillment centers. Python's [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/) was used to generate data within 'input.csv'. 

## Project Objective
A licensed apparel company has the need to separate out orders that are fulfilled in two different methods, 'delivery' and 'pickup'. The input.csv file is coming from their main eCommerce channel.

## Statement of Work
I need to be able to separate out orders based on parameters and write them to different CSV files. It should split on "fulfillment_type" and apply shipping methods. 

## Project Features
- Regular expression text parsing
- Logging
- Use a generic class for processing the order
