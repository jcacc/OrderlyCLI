Order management system for multiple fulfillment centers

## Project Objective:
An order management system that will split an order to be fulfilled from two separate locations

## Statement of Work:
I need to be able to separate out orders based on parameters and write them to different CSV files. It should split on "fulfillment_type" and apply shipping methods. 

## Project Features
- Regular expression text parsing
- Logging
- Use a generic class for processing the order
